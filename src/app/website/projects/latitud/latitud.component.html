    <h3 class="m-0 subtitle-project fs-1 text-capitalize">The Challenge</h3>
    <p class="m-0 description-project">Was to design the website for <strong class="bolder-font">Latitude 90°, MG Weber's commercial photography studio.</strong> The goal was to create a digital experience that reflected the visual, emotional, and narrative magnitude of the images captured by the <strong class="bolder-font"> photographer in some of the most extreme and remote locations on the planet: glaciers and polar regions.</strong></p>
    <p class="m-0 description-project">One of the main challenges was finding the balance between the powerful visual aesthetics of the photographs and intuitive and functional navigation, especially for a professional audience looking to acquire exclusive usage rights for campaigns, editorials, and global brands. The content had to communicate not only visual beauty but also <strong class="bolder-font"> commercial value.</strong></p>
    <p class="m-0 description-project">In short, the challenge was to translate the experience of exploring and capturing wilderness into a sophisticated, visually immersive, and commercially effective digital experience.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-content gap-4 d-flex flex-column">
    <h3 class="m-0 subtitle-project fs-1 text-capitalize">Design Process</h3>
    <p class="m-0 description-project">Rom the beginning of the project, I knew that the visual content—the stunning photographs captured by MG Weber in extreme climates—would be the core of the entire experience. Therefore, before moving into visual or aesthetic aspects, we focused on structuring functional wireframes that would help us understand how the navigation flows and what the most logical content hierarchy would be for the user.</p>
    <div class="d-flex flex-column align-items-start">
      <p class="m-0 description-project"><strong class="bolder-font">Main Objective: Clarity and Purpose</strong></p>
      <p class="m-0 description-project">The first step was to define the site's main objectives:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="m-0 container d-flex flex-column gap-4 ms-3">

        Showcase the visual and commercial value of the photographs.

      <li class="list-project">
        Build a visual narrative that supports the credibility of the work on the ground.
      </li>
    </div>
    <p class="m-0 description-project">This led us to<strong class="bolder-font"> design a very clean information architecture,</strong> with a few key sections: <span class="fst-italic">Gallery, Expeditions, About MG Weber, and a section dedicated to Commercial Licensing.</span></p>
  </div>
  <div class="text-content gap-4 d-flex flex-column">
    <h3 class="m-0 subtitle-project fs-1 text-capitalize">Early feedback from the client</h3>
    <p class="m-0 description-project">We shared these wireframes with photographer MG Weber to validate that the narrative and commercial approach aligned with his vision. This allowed us to fine-tune details early on, such as prioritizing certain texts over photographic technique or ensuring that each image told a story, not just a landscape.</p>
